#Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
*757 RUG - Submission 1*

-------

The first Kaggle model submitted was extremely basic. Since most of the individuals in the training set had Survived=0, we submitted a test set where every individual had Survived=0. The result was X% accuracy.

This example was taken from a blogpost by Trevor Stephens (see reference below).
